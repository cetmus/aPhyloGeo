# Summary

A cross-platform application for phylogenetic tree analysis with climate parameters (`aPhyloGeo`) is a pipeline for performing phylogenetic analyses from genetic and climate data. The pipeline provides a suite of analyses adapted to different scenarios, designed to allow the analysis of data sets represented by three different levels: 1) genetic, 2) climatic, and 3) biogeography correlation, all in one package. These levels of similarity (assessed by least squares distance) influence the assumptions used to consider a correlation between the genetics of a species and its habitat during the reconstruction of the multiple alignment required for phylogenetic inference. By selecting an appropriate gene list for the available data defined on a set of species to explain the adaptation of the species according to the Darwinian hypothesis, the user can be confident that these assumptions are taken into account in `aPhyloGeo`.

# Statement of need

`Gala` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. `Gala` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the `Astropy` package [@astropy] (`astropy.units` and
`astropy.coordinates`).

`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in `Gala` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission
[@gaia] by students and experts alike.

# Mathematics

![The workflow of the algorithm. The operations within this workflow include several blocks.](../img/Fig_1.png)

The blocks are highlighted by three different colors.
- The first block (the light blue color) is responsible for creating the trees based on the climate data - performs the function of input parameter validation (see YAML file).
- The second block (the dark yellow color) is responsible for creating the trees based on the genetic data - performs the function of input parameter validation (see YAML file).
- The third block (the light green color) allows the comparaison between the phylogenetic trees (i.e., with genetic data) and the climatic trees - denoted phylogeography step.
- 
Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
